        <p id="first">Industrial systems thrive on predictability. It smooths out the supply chain, improves efficiency and makes many of the participants more comfortable.<br>
        Tomorrow is like yesterday, but perhaps a little faster or cheaper.<br>But breakthroughs, creativity and human connection don’t come from predictability. They come from unpredictable interactions with unknown ideas and voices.<br>
        Just about all bestsellers are surprise bestsellers. All big ideas come out of left field. But if you spend your time looking at left field, they’ll come out of right field instead.<br>
        Chaos is uncomfortable, particularly if you’ve been indoctrinated in the industrial mindset. But if the right people and the right conditions are present, chaos creates possibility.<br>Do it with intent.</p>

        <h2>Dont guard...!</h2>
        <h3 id="2t">Don’t guard your luck..!</h3>

        <p id="second">Maybe we don’t want to talk about it. Perhaps we believe that unexamined luck isn’t quite as fragile.<br>

Perhaps we don’t want to let anyone else in. It could be that we think that success is scarce, and scarcity will somehow preserve it.<br>

Or maybe we want to insist that it’s all due to skill and nothing but skill. Even though we know that this isn’t true.</p>

<h2>“We don’t care”..!</h2>
        <h3 id="3t">“We don’t care” (you won’t let us)</h3>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/86/Ed_Sheeran_-_Don%27t_%28Official_Single_Cover%29.png" width="250" height="200">
        
        <p id="third">The customer service from the freight shipping company that came to my home a few months ago was truly terrible. Not simply a lack of care, but an aggressive embrace of uncaring. Every interaction was offputting and inefficient.<br>

This is the result of sort by price.<br>

It turns out that a lot of freight shipping is done through an intermediary. Software automatically scans all available options and picks the cheapest one.<br>

Which means that brands don’t matter, customer feedback doesn’t matter and reviews don’t matter. Neither does corporate responsibility or employee satisfaction.<br>

All that matters is the price the shipper pays and ultimately the price of the stock.<br>

Sort by price insulates the producer from the customer. When we resort to a single metric, we get what we measure, and the side effects pile up.<br>

More and more, the choices are, “You’ll get a discount and you will get less than you paid for” and /or “you’ll pay a bit more and you’ll get more than you paid for.”</p>
